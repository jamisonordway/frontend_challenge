# Requirements
Using the included api server (see [Installation](#installation)) create a single page application with React. The single page application will be made up of 2 different pages: The first page will be a page that lists all the users in a paginated list. The second page will be a page that displays the user info for the selected user.

The designs for the two pages can be found [Here](./Designs/Inform.png) and [Here](./Designs/UserList.png)

Information about what api requests are available can be found in the [Swagger](#swagger) documentation

## User List
[Design](./Designs/UserList.png)

The user list should contain the following features:

- A List of all users
- The ability to sort users in the lists
- Pagination for the users (Since there are 1000 in the system)

## Information Page
[Design](./Designs/Inform.png)

The information page should contain the following features:

- The header should include the current selected user's name
- A Masthead that shows the currently selected quality
  - Driver, General Style, Social Emotional, and Virtue
- A Chart showing the ranges for each Score with the Real and Ideal score values charted (ranging from -50 to 50)
- Filters for the graph
  - Enable / Disable scores to show
  - Toggle whether to show valid or invalid results
    - Valid, Invalid, All scores
  - Toggle Ideal scores
  - Change selected Quality
